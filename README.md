Hi, This is a simple video game built using javascript and html. In order to run the game just simply clone the project or download the zip file and open the index.html file via a browser then you will be able to play the game.

The controls are as followsðŸ‘‡

for player 1:
  A: forward,
  B: backward,
  W: jump,
  Space: attack

for player 2:
  Left Arrow: forward,
  Right Arrow: backward,
  Up Arrow: jump,
  Enter: attack

  This is a project I did by following a tutorial on YouTube.
  Link for the tutorial if anyone wants to do it tooðŸ‘‡
